# Git Intro

# What is Git

Git is a distributed version control system, which means that a local clone of the project is complete version control repository.  
It allow multipls people to collaborate on the same project simultaneously, keeping track of changes made to the project over time.  

# Key Concepts

Repository - a directory that contains your project's files and a history of changes. Every project tracked by Git has a repository.  
Branch - a version of your project's repository. Braches are used to work on separate features or fixes without affecting the main code.  
Commit - a saved snapshot of changes made to files in a repository.  
Merge - the process of integrating changes from one branch into another.  

# Git Best Practices for DevOps
Commit Often: make small, frequent commits.  
Write Clear Commit Messages: be descriptive in your messages.  
Use Branches for Features: always create a new branch for each feature.  
Review Pull Requests: ensure team members review and approve code before merging.  
Automate with CI/CD: Integrate Git with automation tools to ensure consistency and reduce manual intervention.
