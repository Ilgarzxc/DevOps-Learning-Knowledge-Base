## Pull Request
Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another (usually from a feature branch into the main branch).  
It allows the team:
- review the code  
- discuss changes  
- run automated tests  
- ensure quality before integrating into the main branch  

## Difference between Merge and Squash
### Merge
- Combines two branches and *keep the entire commit history*.  
- Creates a **merge commit**.  
- Useful when you want to preserve every step of development.  

### Squash
- Takes *all commits from a branch and compresses them into a single commit*.  
- Merge becomes cleaner and more linear.  
- Good for small features or messy commit history.  

## Purpose of the code review
A code review ensures that changes are correct, readable, maintainable, secure and aligned with project standards before being merged.
